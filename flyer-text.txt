TO BARONY OR NOT TO BARONY

Greetings good members of Owlsherst! A few months ago a question was brought up at the Shire Meeting whether we would want to consider becoming a barony. A committee was formed, and we looked at the requirements set forth by East Kingdom. We can readily meet those requirements. Before we pursue this any further we want to get your input.

We are holding two “Shire Hall Meetings” (rather than Town Hall Meetings!) to answer questions, gauge interest in going barony, give pros and cons, and determine if we want to work toward this. The meetings are set in 2 locations of our Shire. You may attend either one, or both. Mundane clothing will be the norm.

1.   Lancaster – Thursday, Feb 20th at 7:00, Meduseld Meadery, 252 Harrisburg Ave.
	
2. York – Wednesday, Feb 26th at 7:00, First Church of the Brethren, 2710 Kingston Rd.

If you are interested by all means come to a meeting!  During the meeting we will be discussing the following: 	Kingdom Law and Corporate requirements
		Financial Considerations
		Baronial Awards
		Court and Leadership
		Process and Timeline if we determine this is a go

If you cannot attend either meeting but want to give your feedback/opinion please do so! You can contact any ofo the members of the committee. They are Lady Cordeilla, Lord Gerhard, Mistress Linette, Master Robert, Lady Siobhan, and Lady Orlaithe, chair.  If you have any questions, you can ask on the Owlsherst Facebook Discussion Page, or address an email to blackswan20@comcast.net (Orlaithe).

There will be a meeting to summarize the information we've gathered from the 2 meetings on 
March 11, at the Wednesday Night Gathering at First Church of the Brethren.
